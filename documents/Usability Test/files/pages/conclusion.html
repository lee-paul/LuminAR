	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>
		The usability test of M2 Interactive uncovered twenty potential usability issues that the app currently had. Five of 
        these issues were experienced by all of the participants, and seven other issues were experienced by more than two 
        participants.
		<br><br>
		The experience that the M2 Interactive application provides is greatly tarnished by the issues that its users face. 
        While some of the issues are technical concerns (bugs, crashes, etc.), many of them can be attributed to poor HCI design.
		<br><br>
		All users did not understand how to use the app, and skipped past the instructions on page 8 of the M2 magazine. Such 
        crucial information should be better portrayed to the user in order to avoid confusion, reduce their learning curve and 
        improve their experience with the app. The very minimal instructions displayed for the games were similarly easily missed 
        and caused frustration and inability to play. 
		<br><br>
		Some of the M2 markers (which load the AR content) were located in unideal parts of the magazine. Cramped content and 
        curved pages resulted in poor quality, glitchy content or no content being displayed at all.
		<br><br>
		We believe that M2 Interactive has serious usability concerns that harm the user experience of application.
