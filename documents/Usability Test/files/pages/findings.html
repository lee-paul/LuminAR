	<h2>Findings</h2>
	<p>
		The responses from and observations about each participant were recorded. The information was then 
        collated and assessed for commonalities. We discovered several common usability issues with the M2 
        Interactive app, as well as some issues unique to some participants.
	</p>	
	
	<h3>Participant Responses & Observations</h3>
    <p>
    	Observations about the participant's experience were recorded, as well as the answers to 10 standard 
        questions. Each participant had the opportunity to respond to any observations and their final thoughts 
        were captured. The identity of the participants has been redacted in the documents below to maintain their 
        privacy.

    <h3>Usability Issues Experienced</h3>
    <p>
    	Below is a list of issues experienced, along with a list of effected participants. The list is ordered descending
        by the number of effected participants, with the more prevalent issues displayed at the top of the list.
        <figure>

		</figure>
        
    </p>
    
    <h3>Notable Trend</h3>
    <p>
    	By plotting the number of issues a participant encountered against the number of minutes they spent in the 
        application a negative, Polynomial trend can be observed. This trend suggests that users that spent more 
        time in the application encountered less errors.
        <br><br>
        It is suggested that perhaps some of the issues encountered by the participants are caused by user-error, 
        resultant from the user not spending enough time in the application to execute the tasks in the way they 
        were designed for.

    <h3>Common Usability Issues</h3>
    <p>
    	Of the twenty different issues experienced across the six participants, five issues were experienced by 
        all participants during their use of M2 Interactive. 
		<br><br>
		All users skipped over the instructional guide on page 8 of the magazine, and were unsure how to 
        correctly use the application. As the app does not include an on-app user guide, every participant 
        learnt how to use the app by trial-and-error. During their learning experience, every participant 
        attempted to scan non-interactive pages of the magazine. They also accidentally tapped on a web link 
        button, and were all unwillingly taken out of the app and into the web browser.
		<br><br>
		Five of the six participants did not wish to watch the videos, as they were uninterested in this type of 
        media. Four users experienced issues with 3D models not appearing correctly, and two of those participants 
        found the curve of the page to be partially responsible. Four users misunderstood the meaning of the M2 website 		
        button, and four users either attempted to tap on non-interactive content, or did not know to tap on interactive 
        content.
		<br><br>
		Three participants were unsure about the purpose of the ‘Explore’ button; this includes the single 
        participant who had experienced Augmented Reality previously. All participants that attempted to play 
        the bulldozer game were unable to due to faulty controls.

    <h3>Unique Usability Issues</h3>
    <p>
    	The single user that was able to win the 'pokie' game was unable to submit their details due to the app 
        crashing. All other participants that attempted the 'pokie' game were unable to win.
        <br><br>
        One participant commented that the countdowns on some content were too long. The same participant also 
        claimed that the scanner interface was "annoying." One user stated that the app lacked interactive content, 
        though they also incorrectly interacted with some content during the test.
        <br><br>
        Participant 6 had three unique issues. They experienced fatigue from holding the phone for an extended 
        period of time, found displaying the content to be difficult due to the irregular sizing of the 3D models 
        and did not discover the M2 Interactive logo in the magazine at all.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Discoveries About Human Computer Interaction</h3>
    <p>
    	<b>Multimodal Systems</b><br>
        The observations from our study draw into attention the multimodality of the system. The app features various modes 
        of multimedia with textual and audio-visual content, some with user input and some without. Some subjects of our 
        testing stated they were distracted from the magazine by the app and became more disinterested with the magazine.
        <br><br>
        A review by Maragos, Potamianos & Gros (2008) explains the human “need to extract multi-level information about the 
        structures and their spatio-temporal or cognitive relationships in their world environment.” Explained further, we 
        are stimulated by our sensory organs to derive our perception of the world. The more sensory organs are stimulated, 
        the more we are drawn towards them. Such as our visual, audible and haptic sensors are excited with the interface of 
        the application, we are detracted from the less stimulating media.
        <br><br>
        <b>Inconsistent Behaviour/Features</b><br>
        Some augmented reality features were interactive while some were not, leaving the user in a state of confusion. 
        During our experiment, we noted the number of subjects tapping on the screen during non-interactive content, and 
        not tapping on some interactive content. While testing the AR feature on the bulldozer page, subjects were confused 
        as how to move the vehicle. Although the subjects knew that it was interactive, due to the appearance of a button 
        on the user interface, it was noticed that the users still did not manage to manoeuvre the vehicle in the way they 
        would like to. Accelerating the bulldozer was not obvious; the user had to use position one finger on the button to 
        control steering and another on the screen, off the button to accelerate. Thus, this task proved difficult for most subjects.
        <br><br>
        Livingston (2013) states, “Careful and detailed study of perceptual factors first lead to optimal performance or 
        configuration of component technologies, and then more cognitively-demanding tasks are used for evaluation of (complex 
        pieces of) the system.” In relation to our study, we derived poor performance was a result of the misguided perception of 
        control input and therefore were unable to evaluate whether the task of manoeuvring the bulldozer was effective e.g. in 
        terms of sensitivity in control, speed and dynamics.
