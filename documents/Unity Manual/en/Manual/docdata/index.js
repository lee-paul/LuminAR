During the shading calculation, each vertex normal is compared with the direction of the incoming light, which is also a vector. If the two vectors are perfectly aligned, then the surface is receiving light head-on at that point and the full brightness of the light will be used for shading. A light coming exactly side-on to the normal vector will give no illumination to the surface at that position. Typically, the light will arrive at an angle to the normal and so the shading will be somewhere in between full brightness and complete darkness, depending on the angle.",6],["Since the mesh is made up of triangles, it may seem that the normals at corners will simply be perpendicular to the plane of their triangle. However, normals are actually interpolated across the triangle to give the surface direction of the intermediate positions between the corners. If all three normals are pointing in the same direction then the triangle will be uniformly lit all over. The effect of having separate triangles uniformly shaded is that the edges will be very crisp and distinct. This is exactly what is required for a model of a cube or other sharp-edged solid but the interpolation of the normals can be used to create smooth shading to approximate a curved surface.",6],["To get crisp edges, it is necessary to double up vertices at each edge since both of the two adjacent triangles will need their own separate normals.",6],["For curved surfaces, vertices will usually be shared along edges but a bit of intuition is often required to determine the best direction for the shared normals. A normal might simply be the average of the normals of the planes of the surrounding triangles. However, for an object like a sphere, the normals should just be pointing directly outward from the sphere's centre.",6],["By calling Mesh.RecalculateNormals, you can get Unity to work out the normals' directions for you by making some assumptions about the \"meaning\" of the mesh geometry; it assumes that vertices shared between triangles indicate a smooth surface while doubled-up vertices indicate a crisp edge. While this is not a bad approximation in most cases, RecalculateNormals will be tripped up by some texturing situations where vertices must be doubled even though the surface is smooth.",6],["Texturing",6],["In addition to the lighting, a model will also typically make use of texturing to create fine detail on its surface. A texture is a bit like an image printed on a stretchable sheet of rubber. For each mesh triangle, a triangular area of the texture image is defined and that texture triangle is stretched and \"pinned\" to fit the mesh triangle. To make this work, each vertex needs to store the coordinates of the image position that will be pinned to it. These coordinates are two dimensional and scaled to the 0..1 range (0 means the bottom/left of the image and 1 means the right/top). To avoid confusing these coordinates with the Cartesian coordinates of the 3D world, they are referred to as U and V rather than the more familiar X and Y, and so they are commonly called UV coordinates.",6],["Like normals, texture coordinates are unique to each vertex and so there are situations where you need to double up vertices purely to get different UV values across an edge. An obvious example is where two adjacent triangles use discontinuous parts of the texture image (eyes on a face texture, say). Also, most objects that are fully enclosed volumes will need a \"seam\" where an area of texture wraps around and joins together. The UV values at one side of the seam will be different from those at the other side.",6],["See Also",6],["Using the Mesh Class page.",6],["Mesh scripting class reference.",6],["Android Scripting",7],["Most features of the Android devices are exposed through the Input and Handheld classes.

Because Unity samples the animation according to the variable frame rate of the game, it may sample it when the rotation is just below 90 degrees, and the next time right after it reached 90 degrees. If you need to be notified when a specific point in an animation is reached, you should use an AnimationEvent instead.",27],["Note also that as a consequence of the variable framerate sampling, an animation that is played back using WrapMode.Once may not be sampled at the exact time of the last frame. In one frame of the game the animation may be sampled just before the end of the animation, and in the next frame the time can have exceeded the length of the animation, so it is disabled and not sampled further.

If you use Quaternion interpolation and place two keys further apart than 180 degrees, the curve will look discontinuous, even though the actual rotation is still smooth - it simply goes the other way around, because it is shorter. If rotations larger than 180 degrees are desired, additional keys must be placed in between. When using Quaternion interpolation, changing the keys or tangents of one curve may also change the shapes of the other two curves, since all three curves are created from the internal Quaternion representation. When using Quaternion interpolation, keys are always linked, so that creating a key at a specific time for one of the three curves will also create a key at that time for the other two curves.",34],["Euler Angles Interpolation",34],["Euler Angles interpolation is what most people are used to working with.

When Euler Angles interpolation is used, Unity internally bakes the curves into the Quaternion representation used internally.

For example, you might want to create a map or information display that is not supposed to appear exactly like a real-world object.

The shape is not exactly a pyramid, however, because the top is cut off by the near clipping plane; this kind of truncated pyramid shape is known as a frustum.

As its name suggests, a skybox behaves like a \"box\" lined with images of a sky. The camera is effectively placed at the center of this box and can see the sky from all directions. The camera sees a different area of sky as it rotates but it never moves from the center (so the camera cannot get \"closer\" to the sky). The skybox is rendered behind all objects in the scene and so it represents a view at infinite distance. The most common usage is to represent the sky in a standard outdoor scene but the box actually surrounds the camera completely, even underneath.

In velocity mode, the spring force is dependent on the \"distance\" between the current velocity and the target velocity; the damper helps the velocity to settle at the chosen value rather than oscillating endlessly around it.

A collider, which is invisible, need not be the exact same shape as the object's mesh and in fact, a rough approximation is often more efficient and indistinguishable in gameplay. The simplest (and least processor-intensive) colliders and the so-called primitive collider types. In 3D, these are the Box Collider, Sphere Collider and Capsule Collider. In 2D, you can use the Box Collider 2D and Circle Collider 2D. Any number of these can be added to a single object to create compound colliders. With careful positioning and sizing, compound colliders can often approximate the shape of an object quite well while keeping a low processor overhead. Further flexibility can be gained by having additional colliders on child objects (eg, boxes can be rotated relative to the local axes of the parent object). However, you should be sure that there is only one Rigidbody and this should be placed on the root object in the hierarchy. Note, that primitive colliders will not work correctly with shear transforms - that means that if you use a combination of rotations and non-uniform scales in the tranform hierarchy so that the resulting shape would no longer match a primitive shape, the primitive collider will not be able to represent it correctly.",273],["There are some cases, however, where even compound colliders are not accurate enough. In 3D, you can use Mesh Colliders to match the shape of the object's mesh exactly. In 2D, the Polygon Collider 2D will generally not match the shape of the sprite graphic perfectly but you can refine the shape to any level of detail you like. These colliders are much more processor-intensive than primitive types, however, so use them sparingly to maintain good performance. Also, a mesh collider will normally be unable to collide with another mesh collider (ie, nothing will happen when they make contact). You can get around this in some cases by marking the mesh collider as Convex in the inspector. This will generate the collider shape as a \"convex hull\" which is like the original mesh but with any undercuts filled in. The benefit of this is that a convex mesh collider can collide with other mesh colliders so you may be able to use this feature when you have a moving character with a suitable shape. However, a good general rule is to use mesh colliders for scene geometry and approximate the shape of moving objects using compound primitive colliders.",273],["Colliders can be added to an object without a Rigidbody component to create floors, walls and other motionless elements of a scene. These are referred to as static colliders. In general, you should not reposition static colliders by changing the Transform position since this will impact heavily on the performance of the physics engine. Colliders on an object that does have a Rigidbody are known as dynamic colliders. Static colliders can interact with dynamic colliders but since they don't have a Rigidbody, they will not move in response to collisions.",273],["The reference pages for the various collider types linked above have further information about their properties and uses.",273],["Physics materials",273],["When colliders interact, their surfaces need to simulate the properties of the material they are supposed to represent. For example, a sheet of ice will be slippery while a rubber ball will offer a lot of friction and be very bouncy. Although the shape of colliders is not deformed during collisions, their friction and bounce can be configured using Physics Materials. Getting the parameters just right can involve a bit of trial and error but an ice material, for example will have zero (or very low) friction and a rubber material with have high friction and near-perfect bounciness. See the reference pages for Physic Material and Physics Material 2D for further details on the available parameters.

Full details of these functions and code samples can be found on the Script Reference page for the MonoBehaviour class.",273],["With normal, non-trigger collisions, there is an additional detail that at least one of the objects involved must have a non-kinematic Rigidbody (ie, Is Kinematic must be switched off).

Consequently, static colliders should not be disabled/enabled, moved or scaled during gameplay. If you do change a static collider then this will result in extra internal recomputation by the physics engine which causes a major drop in performance. Worse still, the changes can sometimes leave the collider in an undefined state that produces erroneous physics calculations. For example a raycast against an altered Static Collider could fail to detect it, or detect it at a random position in space. Furthermore, Rigidbodies that are hit by a moving static collider will not necessarily be \"awoken\" and the static collider will not apply any friction. For these reasons, only colliders that are Rigidbodies should be altered. If you want a collider object that is not affected by incoming rigidbodies but can still be moved from a script then you should attach a Kinematic Rigidbody component to it rather than no Rigidbody at all.",273],["Rigidbody Collider",273],["This is a GameObject with a Collider and a normal, non-kinematic Rigidbody attached.

You can move a kinematic rigidbody object from a script by modifying its Transform Component but it will not respond to collisions and forces like a non-kinematic rigidbody.

An example of this is a sliding door that should normally act as an immovable physical obstacle but can be opened when necessary. Unlike a static collider, a moving kinematic rigidbody will apply friction to other objects and will \"wake up\" other rigidbodies when they make contact.",273],["Even when immobile, kinematic rigidbody colliders have different behavior to static colliders. For example, if the collider is set to as a trigger then you also need to add a rigidbody to it in order to receive trigger events in your script.

Modelling indirect lighting allows for effects that make the virtual world seem more realistic and connected, since objects affect each other’s appearance. One classic example is ‘color bleeding’ where, for example, sunlight hitting a red sofa will cause red light to be bounced onto the wall behind it. Another is when sunlight hits the floor at the opening of a cave and bounces around inside so the inner parts of the cave are illuminated too.",348],["GI Concepts",348],["Traditionally, video games and other realtime graphics applications have been limited to direct lighting, while the calculations required for indirect lighting were too slow so they could only be used in non-realtime situations such as CG animated films. A way for games to work around this limitation is to calculate indirect light only for objects and surfaces that are known ahead of time to not move around (that are static). That way the slow computation can be done ahead of time, but since the objects don’t move, the indirect light that is pre-calculated this way will still be correct at runtime. Unity supports this technique, called Baked GI (also known as Baked Lightmaps), which is named after \"the bake\" - the process in which the indirect light is precalculated and stored (baked). In addition to indirect light, Baked GI also takes advantage of the greater computation time available to generate more realistic soft shadows from area lights and indirect light than what can normally be achieved with realtime techniques.",348],["Additionally, Unity 5.0 adds support for a new technique called Precomputed Realtime GI. It still requires a precomputation phase similar to the bake mentioned above, and it is still limited to static objects. However it doesn’t just precompute how light bounces in the scene at the time it is built, but rather it precomputes all possible light bounces and encodes this information for use at runtime. So essentially for all static objects it answers the question \"if any light hits this surface, where does it bounce to?\" Unity then saves this information about which paths light can propagate by for later use. The final lighting is done at runtime by feeding the actual lights present into these previously computed light propagation paths.",348],["This means that the number and type of lights, their position, direction and other properties can all be changed and the indirect lighting will update accordingly. Similarly it’s also possible to change material properties of objects, such as their color, how much light they absorb or how much light they emit themselves.",348],["While Precomputed Realtime GI also results in soft shadows, they will typically have to be more coarse-grained than what can be achieved with Baked GI unless the scene is very small. Also note that while Precomputed Realtime GI does the final lighting at runtime, it does so iteratively over several frames, so if a big a change is done in the lighting, it will take more frames for it to fully take effect. And while this is fast enough for realtime applications, if the target platform has very constrained resources it may be better to to use Baked GI for better runtime performance.",348],["Limitations of GI",348],["Both Baked GI and Precomputed Realtime GI have the limitation that only static objects can be included in the bake/precomputation - so moving objects cannot bounce light onto other objects and vice versa. However they can still pick up bounce light from static objects using Light Probes. Light Probes are positions in the scene where the light is measured (probed) during the bake/precomputation, and then at runtime the indirect light that hits non-static objects is approximated using the values from the probes that the object is closest to at any given moment.

Then, some time later, the Garbage Collector runs, and it removes anything in memory that is not referenced anywhere.

With these issues in mind, it should be apparent that performance will suffer if you allocate pools that are too large or keep them active when the objects they contain will not be needed for some time.

A fundamental idea is that of the relationship between the client (the computer that is requesting information) and the server (the computer responding to the information request). The server can either be a dedicated host machine used by all clients, or simply a player machine running the game (client) but also acting as the server for other players. Once a server has been established and a client has connected to it, the two computers can exchange data as demanded by gameplay.",491],["Creating a network game requires a lot of attention to some very specific details. Even though network actions are easy to design and create in Unity, networking remains rather complex. A major design decision in Unity is to make networking as robust and flexible as possible. This means that you, as the game creator, are responsible for things that might be handled in an automatic but less robust way in other engines. The choices you make potentially have a major effect on the design of your game, so it is best to make them as early in the design stage as possible. Understanding networking concepts will help you plan your game design well and avoid problems during the implementation.",491],["Networking Approaches",491],["There are two common and proven approaches to structuring a network game which are known as Authoritative Server and Non-Authoritative Server.

Each client sends their input (in the form of keystrokes or requested actions) to the server and continuously receives the current state of the game from the server. The client never makes any changes to the game state itself. Instead, it tells the server what it wants to do, and the server then handles the request and replies to the client to explain what happened as a result.",491],["Fundamentally, there is a layer of separation between what the player wants to do and what actually happens. This allows the server to listen to every client's requests before deciding how to update the game state.",491],["An advantage of this approach is that it makes cheating much harder for clients. For example, clients do not have the possibility of cheating by telling the server (and thereby other clients) that an enemy has been killed, since they don't get to make that decision by themselves. They can only tell the server that a weapon was fired and from there, it is up to the server to determine whether or not a kill was made.",491],["Another example of an authoritative server would be a multiplayer game that relies on physics. If each client is allowed to run its own physics simulation then small variations between clients could cause them to drift out of sync with each other gradually. However, if the simulation of all physics objects is handled on a central server then the updated state can be sent back to the clients, guaranteeing they are all consistent.",491],["A potential disadvantage with authoritative servers is the time it takes for the messages to travel over the network. If the player presses a control to move forward and it takes a tenth of a second for the response to return from the server then the delay will be perceptible to the player. One solution to this is to use so-called client-side prediction. The essence of this technique is that the client is allowed to update its own local version of the game state but it must be able to receive corrections from the server's authoritative version where necessary. Typically, this should only be used for simple game actions and not significant logical changes to game state. For example, it would be unwise to report to a player that an enemy has been killed only for the server to override this decision.",491],["Since client-side prediction is an advanced subject, we don't attempt to cover it in this guide but books and web resources are available if you want to investigate it further.",491],["An authoritative server has a greater processing overhead than a non-authoritative one.

For example, if a client flips a switch to open a door, it can send an RPC to the server telling it that the door has been opened. The server can then send another RPC to all clients, invoking their local functions to open that same door.

Simply explained, the private address goes through a local router which translates the address into a public address. By doing this, many machines with private addresses can use a single public IP address to communicate with the internet. This is fine until someone elsewhere on the internet wants to initiate contact with one of the private addresses. The communication must happen via the public address of the router, which must then pass the message on to the private address. A technique called NAT punchthrough uses a shared server known as a facilitator to mediate communication in such a way that the private address can be reached from the public address. This works by having the private address first contact the facilitator, which \"punches\" a hole through the local router. The facilitator can now see the public IP address and port which the private address is using. Using this information, any machine on the internet can now connect directly with the otherwise unreachable private address. (Note that the details of NAT punchthrough are somewhat more complicated than this in practice.)",491],["Public addresses are more straightforward. Here, the main issue is that connectivity can be blocked by an internal or external firewall (an internal firewall is one that runs locally on the computer it is protecting). For an internal firewall, the user can be asked to remove restrictions from a particular port so as to make the game server accessible. An external firewall, by contrast, is not under the control of the users. Unity can attempt to use NAT punchthrough to get access through an external firewall but this technique is not guaranteed to succeed. Our testing suggests that it generally works in practice but there doesn't appear to be any formal research that confirms this finding.",491],["The connectivity issues just mentioned affect servers and clients differently. Client requests involve only outgoing network traffic which is relatively straightforward. If the client has a public address then this almost always works since outgoing traffic is typically only blocked on corporate networks that impose severe access restrictions. If the client has a private address it can connect to all servers except servers with private addresses which cannot do NAT punchthrough (more will be said about this later). The server end is more complicated because the server needs to be able to accept incoming connections from unknown sources. With a public address, the server needs to have the game port open to the internet (ie, not blocked by a firewall). or else it cannot accept any connections from clients and is thus unusable. If the server has a private address it must be able to do NAT punchthrough to allow connections and clients must also permit NAT punchthrough in order to connect to it.",491],["Unity provides tools to test all these different connectivity situations.

This is often the best synchronization mode to use when objects change state very frequently and the effect of a missed update is very short-lived. However, you should bear in mind the amount of data that might be sent during each update. For example, synchronizing a Transform involves transmitting nine float values (three Vector3s with three floats each), which equates to 36 Bytes per update. If the server is running with eight clients and using the default update frequency then it will receive 4,320 KBytes/s (8*36*15) or 34.6Kbits/s and transmit 30.2 KBytes/s (8*7*36*15) or 242Kbits/s.

Although this may be desirable in some cases, typically it will be enough for the character to be seen as walking, running, jumping, etc. The animations can thus be crudely synchronized simply by sending an integer value to denote which animation sequence to play.
